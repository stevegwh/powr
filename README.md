# Prop-Oriented World Rotation - an experimental VR technique

_Submitted for the MSc in Computer Science at University of Kent (Received 78% - Distinction)_

"POWR" is an experimental technique to enable games to map objects from the user's physical environment to objects in the virtual world. For example, the user's bed in their room physically reinforcing a crate in the virtual world. This allows the users to benefit from haptic feedback from the virtual world without the need for any bespoke prop or device.

Video explanation: The game is a simple shooter where you shoot all the robots to advance to the next checkpoint. Each checkpoint has a virtual object the player uses for cover which is scaled and mapped to physical object in the user's room. The crate object is mapped to the bed and any door object in the game is mapped to the door of the room. This allows the player to lean on/ use the physical objects intuitively while also resulting in fewer collisions with objects from around their room.
